## <a name="goals">Learning Goals</a>

Upon completing this course, you will be able to:

* Describe the hierarchy of abstractions that define a modern computer:
    - Logic gates
    - CPU
    - Machine language
    - Assembly language and assemblers
    - Virtual machines
    - High-level languages and compilers
    - The operating system
* Understand and apply the basic boolean logical operators.
* Create a digital circuit corresponding to a specification given in boolean logic.
* Create a digital circuit capable of performing addition from boolean logic.
* Create a digital circuit employing clocked memory components.
* Describe how boolean logic, memory circuits, and a clock pulse interact to execute a machine language instruction.
* Describe the relationship between an assembly language and its corresponding machine language.
* Write a program in assembly language.
* Create an assembler to translate an assembly language into machine language .
* Given two programming languages, articulate a rationale as to why one of them ought to be considered higher-level (or lower-level) than the other.
* Describe the role and major components of a compiler.
* Describe how a operating system enables a programmer to access the computer's hardware.
