# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  *How do computers work?*  This course answers this deceptively simple
  question by providing a deep dive into the layers of abstraction
  composing modern computing systems. Throughout the semester,
  you will put your new knowledge into practice by building your own
  complete, working (simulated) computer. Course topics include
  numeric representation, digital logic, CPU design, machine and
  assembly language, the program stack, virtual machines, compilers,
  assemblers, memory management and device drivers.
