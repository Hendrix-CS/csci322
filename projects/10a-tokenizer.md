* **Description**: Complete [Stage I (tokenizer) of Project 10 on
      nand2tetris.org](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project10).

* **What to turn in**: Turn in all files necessary for running your
  tokenizer.  Your tokenizer can be written in any language you wish.

* **Hints**

    - Test your tokenizer on the `.jack` files in the `ArrayTest`,
      `ExpressionLessSquare`, and `Square` folders.

    - For each `Xxx.jack` source file, have your tokenizer test
      program give the output file the name `XxxT.xml` (notice the
      `T`!). Apply your tokenizer test to each class file in the test
      programs, then use the supplied `TextComparer` utility to compare
      the generated output to the supplied `.xml` compare files (on
      Linux or Mac OS, you can also use the built-in `diff` utility to
      compare files).

    - Since the output files generated by your tokenizer test will
      have the same names and extensions as those of the supplied
      comparison files, we suggest putting them in separate directories.

* **Specification**: To get credit for this project, you must complete
  a working tokenizer which accepts the name of a `.jack` file as a
  command-line argument and outputs a corresponding XML file with the
  same name but a `T` added to the end of the file name and an `.xml`
  extension. (For example, `foo.jack` should become `fooT.xml`.)  For
  each of the following input `.jack` files, your tokenizer must
  output an `.xml` file which is identical to the provided comparison
  `.xml` file:

    - `ArrayTest/Main.jack`
    - `ExpressionLessSquare/Main.jack`
    - `ExpressionLessSquare/SquareGame.jack`
    - `ExpressionLessSquare/Square.jack`
    - `Square/Main.jack`
    - `Square/SquareGame.jack`
    - `Square/Square.jack`
