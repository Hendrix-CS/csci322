* **Description**: Complete [Project 9 on
      nand2tetris.org](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project09) by
      designing and implementing an application to run on the Hack
      platform, using the Jack language.

* **What to turn in**:

    - You are strongly encouraged (but not required) to run your
      idea(s) by me so I can give you feedback and help you choose
      something with an appropriate level of difficulty.

    - For the finished project itself, turn in a `.zip` or `.tgz` file
      containing all the `.jack` files necessary to run your application.

* **Specification**: To get credit for this project, you must meet the
  following requirements:

    - Your project must contain at least two `.jack` files.

    - Your project must compile and run successfully.

    - Your project must be at least 100 lines of Jack code, not
      counting blank lines and comments.

    - Your project should accomplish something interesting (for
      example, you cannot fulfill the above specification simply by
      writing a 100-line program that prints the number 5
      repeatedly).  If you are unsure whether your project meets this
      criterion, please ask.
