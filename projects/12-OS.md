* **Description**: Complete [Project 12 on
      nand2tetris.org](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project12) by
      implementing the Jack OS.

* **Part A due**: {{page.dueA}} @5pm; **Part B due**: {{page.dueB}} @5pm.

* **What to turn in**:
    - For Part A, you should turn in `Sys.jack`, `Array.jack`,
      `String.jack`, `Keyboard.jack`, and `Math.jack`.

    - For Part B, you should turn in `Screen.jack`, `Output.jack`, and
      `Memory.jack`.

* **Specification**: To get credit for each part, your `.jack` files
  must pass the relevant tests.  For each file `Foo.jack`, there is a
  corresponding test in the provided `FooTest` directory.  Note that a
  few of these tests are not automated, with a `.tst` file that can be
  loaded in the VM emulator, but most you will need to test
  manually. In general, to test `Foo.jack`, you should

    - Copy your `Foo.jack` file into the `FooTest` folder.
    - Run a Jack compiler on the `FooTest` folder to generate
      `Main.vm` and `Foo.vm` (you can use your own Jack compiler if
      you wish, but you are also welcome to use the `JackCompiler`
      provided with the nand2tetris materials).
    - If there is a `.tst` file in the folder, load it in the VM
      emulator.  Otherwise, simply load the `FooTest` folder itself.
      In either case, the VM emulator will use built-in
      implementations of all OS functions *except* that it will use
      your functions from `Foo.jack`.  This way you can test each file
      in isolation.
    - Make sure the test works as required (see the comments and code
      in each `Main.jack` file for information on what to expect).

  Finally, to get credit for Part B (or whichever part you happen to
  do second), it must also be possible to compile and run the `Pong`
  game using your complete OS implementation in place of the built-in
  one.
