* **Description**: Complete [Project 6 on
      nand2tetris.org](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project06).

* **What to turn in**: Turn in all files necessary for running your
  assembler.

* **Specification**: To get credit for this project, you must complete
  a working assembler program and pass all the provided tests
  (`Add.asm`, `Max.asm`, `Rect.asm`, `Pong.asm`): in particular, given
  these files as input, your assembler must produce identical output
  to that of the assembler provided with the nand2tetris software
  suite.

    **Note** that the test cases for this project are **not**
    automated! You will need to manually test each of your assembled
    programs to make sure they work and are identical to those
    produced by the provided assembler.

* **Due**: {{page.due}} @5pm.
