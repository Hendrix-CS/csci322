* **Description**:
    - Complete [Project 2 on
      nand2tetris.org](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project02).
    - Additionally, implement an `Or16Way` chip, using the files
      linked below (you can download them and place them in the same
      folder as the other project 2 files).  You may find this chip
      helpful in completing the rest of the project.
        - [`Or16Way.hdl`](../static/Or16Way.hdl)
        - [`Or16Way.cmp`](../static/Or16Way.cmp)
        - [`Or16Way.tst`](../static/Or16Way.tst)

* **What to turn in**: Turn in all your `.hdl` files, one for each
  chip, including `Or16Way.hdl`.  There should be 7 in all
  (`HalfAdder`, `FullAdder`, `Add16`, `Inc16`, `ALU-nostat`,
  `Or16Way`, `ALU`).

* **Specification**: To get credit for this project, you must complete
  all 7 chips and pass the tests for each.

* **Due**: {{page.due}} @5pm.
